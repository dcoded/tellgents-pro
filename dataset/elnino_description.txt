We collected our El Nino data set from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Database, who received the data from the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory. 

The directory containing the data exists at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/el_nino-mld/

Each line contains a single data entry, with the following columns:

1. buoy - a unique identifier for a specific physical buoy. Range 1-59
2. day - the day the data was collected, as an integer. Range 1-14
3. lattitude - geographical lattitude (north-south position)
4. longitude - geographical longitude (east-west position) 
5. zon.winds - wind speed along the lattitude circle
6. mer.winds - wind speed along the longitudinal circle
7. humidity - relative humidity value for the specific buoy
8. air temp - temperature of the air above the water at the buoy point
9. s.s.temp - temperature of the water at the sea surface (underwater)

There are some missing data attributes for a subset of the data, which is represented by a single period.
